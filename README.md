# Image-Classification

## Project name : Image Classification
## Duration : Feb 2018 – Mar 2018

## Objective

   #### ● Normalize the images and the labels.
   #### ● Preprocess the images with one-hot encode.
   #### ● Build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.
   #### ● Observe the neural network's predictions on the sample images.

## Project description :
#### ● In this project, the goal was to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, ships, Automobile, dogs, cats, and other objects.

#### ● The dataset needed to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. Further, the task was to normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels &next to build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer.

#### ● At the end, their predictions on the sample images were derived.



## This project contains 3 files:

   #### ● image_classification.ipynb: This is the main file where all code is present.
   #### ● Two helper files, problem_unittests.py and helper.py
